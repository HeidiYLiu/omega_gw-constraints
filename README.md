The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the radiation remnant from the Big Bang. After the big bang, the early Universe was denser and much hotter. The tightly coupled system of photons, electrons, and protons behaved as a "single gas" (matter), and it trapped radiation (light) [4].

As the Universe expanded and cooled, matter lost its ability to ensnare light. Around 380,000 years after the big bang— the temperature of the gas decreased enough for the protons to capture the electrons and become atoms. This phase is called recombination [4].

After recombination, the photons (light) were no longer scattered by collisions with charged particles and are free to travel largely unimpeded through space. After 14 billion years, this release of photons became the CMB we see today [4].

Small disturbances in the early Universe made the "single gas" propagate as sound waves. The gas from the rarefied (cooling the gas) and compressed (heating the gas) regions froze into the CMB and created temperature anisotropies. [4]. 

But what is the source of initial disturbances that triggered the sound wave?
